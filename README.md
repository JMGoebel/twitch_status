### Show the Local Weather

#### Objective:  Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/

1. [ ] User can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

2. [ ] User can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.

3. [ ] If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

4. [ ] User will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). 
    You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.
