#### Objective:  Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/

- [ ] User can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

- [ ] User can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.

- [ ] If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

- [ ] User will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). 
    You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.


Test Case
["ESL_SC2", "OgamingSC2", "cretetion", "freecodecamp", "storbeck", "habathcx", "RobotCaleb", "noobs2ninjas", "brunofin", "comster404"]
